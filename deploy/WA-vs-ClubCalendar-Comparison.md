# WA Event Calendar vs ClubCalendar: Functional Comparison

This document compares how well each calendar helps members accomplish common tasks.

---

## The Core Problem

SBNC has 150+ events per month across 30+ committees. Members need to quickly find events that:

- They can actually attend (not sold out)
- Fit their budget
- Match their interests
- Work with their schedule

---

## Task-Based Comparison

### Task 1: "Find an event I can sign up for this weekend"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Look at Saturday and Sunday on the calendar
2. Click on first event → check if sold out → click back
3. Click on second event → check if sold out → click back
4. Repeat until you find one with availability
5. Hope you remember which ones were full

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Click "Weekend" button
2. Click "Has Openings" button
3. Browse only events you can actually join

**Time saved:** 5-10 clicks per event avoided

---

### Task 2: "What free or low-cost events are coming up?"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Click on first event → scroll to see price → click back
2. Click on second event → scroll to see price → click back
3. Mentally track which were affordable
4. Repeat for every event of interest

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Select "Free" or "Under $25" from Price dropdown
2. See only matching events, each showing $ indicator

**Time saved:** Eliminates click-and-remember cycle entirely

---

### Task 3: "I want to find hiking or outdoor activities"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Know that "happy hikers" is the tag name (not "hiking")
2. Find and check the correct tag checkbox
3. Hope other outdoor events are tagged consistently

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Select "Physical/Fitness" from Activity dropdown, OR
2. Select "Outdoor" from Venue dropdown, OR
3. Type "hike" in search box

**Advantage:** Multiple ways to find what you want; doesn't require knowing tag names

---

### Task 4: "What evening events are available for working members?"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Visually scan each day for events starting after 5pm
2. No way to filter—must look at every event time

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Click "After Hours" button
2. See only evening events (5pm+), color-coded purple

**Time saved:** Instant filtering vs. visual scanning of entire calendar

---

### Task 5: "What events am I signed up for?"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Navigate away from calendar to profile page
2. Find "My Event Registrations" section
3. View list with limited information
4. Navigate back to calendar to continue browsing

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Click "My Events" tab (stays on same page)
2. See registered events, waitlist status, past events
3. Click "Events" tab to continue browsing

**Advantage:** No context-switching; everything in one place

---

### Task 6: "Is that wine tasting event still available?"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Scroll through calendar looking for the event
2. Click on it to see details
3. Look for availability information

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Type "wine" or "tasting" in search box
2. See matching events with availability badges visible
3. "Sold Out" or "5 spots left" shown without clicking

**Time saved:** Search + at-a-glance availability

---

### Task 7: "I want to explore new committees"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Browse events and try to identify committee from titles
2. Check/uncheck tags one at a time to explore
3. Tag names may not match committee names

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Open Committee dropdown
2. See all active committees listed
3. Select one to see only their events
4. Committee name shown clearly on each event card

**Advantage:** Designed for committee-based organization

---

### Task 8: "Show me what's coming up in February"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Navigate calendar month-by-month
2. No way to see a specific date range

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Set "From" date to Feb 1
2. Set "To" date to Feb 28
3. See only February events in list or calendar

**Advantage:** Precise date range filtering

---

### Task 9: "I only care about workshops and classes"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. No way to filter by event type
2. Must scan all events looking for workshop/class keywords

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Select "Workshop" or "Class" from Event Type dropdown
2. See only learning-focused events

**Advantage:** Filter by what kind of event, not just who hosts it

---

### Task 10: "When does registration open for that popular event?"

**With WA Calendar:**

1. Find the event
2. Click to open details
3. Look for registration dates in the description (if provided)

**With ClubCalendar:**

1. Events with future registration show "Opens in X days" badge
2. Visible without clicking into the event

**Advantage:** Coming-soon visibility helps members plan ahead

## The Bottom Line

**WA Calendar** works like a basic bulletin board—it shows you what exists, but finding what you want requires clicking through events one by one.

**ClubCalendar** works like a smart assistant—it helps you filter, search, and see key information (availability, price, timing) without hunting for it.

For a club with 150+ monthly events, the difference between "click each event to learn about it" and "filter to exactly what you want" is significant member experience improvement.
